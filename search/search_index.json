'Override from adjacent' - replace broken weights on selected vertices from adjacent geometry. Video Tutorial \u00b6 For blender 2.79 but lots of things are the same in Blender2.8 Installation \u00b6 To install Weight Paint Tools you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to Weight Paint Tools_2.x.zip (for Blender 2.8) file location. Updating \u00b6 Weight Paint Tools has build in auto updater. When you use it, updater will download latest Weight Paint Tools release and install in background. To use auto updater go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Weight Paint Tools -> press 'Check for update'. If new version is found, press ' Update addon ' button, wait few seconds for download, installation and restart blender. Or you download update manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Weight Paint Tools. Location \u00b6 Weight Paint Tools pie menu in Weight Paint Mode: ' Ctrl+X ' hotkey (can be changed in addon preferences).

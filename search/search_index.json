Set active vertex group weight to one of values: 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1 . Then you can increase or decrease weights by +/- 0.1 by scrolling up or down with middle mouse button. There are three mixing modes (changed by pressing 'M' key): Replace - replaces existing weighs with new target value. Add - add weight to old one Subtract - remove weight from old one You may also choose to normalize resulting weights (with 'N' key). Pick weight helper button - copies active vertex group weight ( 0.607 ) from vertex. Now you can use icon on right, to fill selected vertices with this 0.607 weight Fill vertex weight \u00b6 Filling dark spots (low vertex weights) with head bone weight, to pin hair to head If vertex weight is low (total sum of vert weights is below 1), then increase active vertex group weight until sum reaches 100% Select active vertex group bone \u00b6 On more complicated rigs it may be hard to find bone that influences selected vertices Select bone based on current active vertex group Copy / Paste Vertex weights \u00b6 You can copy one vertex weight (from belt), and paste to pouch to make it more rigid (it will have same vertex weights on all vertices) Copy all Vertex weights from selection and paste to target vertices. you can copy one vertex weights to multiple target vertices (like on gif above) if you copy N vertices, then paste to N target vertices, the order of selected vertices weights will be preserved Transfer Vertex Weights \u00b6 Transfer weights from eyelid bone to head bone on selected vertices Select source bone A - then target bone - B. Weights on selected vertices will be moved from vertex group A to B This operator has few properties (F9) key: Mixing Method of vertex group A with B (target / receiver): Replace - Replace weight B with A Add - Add A to B Lighten - Lighten Difference - substract weighs A from B Multiply - Multiply A timex B Clear Source Weights - if true remove vertex weights from source vertex group A Mirror Weights \u00b6 I want to fix characters weights on right side, so I copy nice gradients from left side Mirror selected vertices weights to opposite side of mesh. To use it, select properly weighted side of mesh, and then run 'Mirror Weights'. The mirroring accuracy is defined by ' Symmetry Search Distance ' parameter. Properties (F9): All Groups - if True mirror all vertex group from selected vertices (or just active one if set to False) Symmetrize - instead of mirroring vertex group from left bone to right bone, symmetrize vertex group(s). Useful for center bones - eg spine. Symmetrize vs non symmetrize version Mirror Project Weights \u00b6 Fixing broken pants. Notice that pants topology is not symmetrical Same as 'Mirror Weights' but works great with non symmetrical topology meshes. The main difference in workflow is that you select the 'broken' side of mesh first, then run 'Mirror Project', so it is reverse of how normal 'Mirror Weights' work (where you select fixed side of mesh first) Properties (F9): All Groups - if True mirror all vertex group to selected vertices (or just active one if set to False) Symmetrize - instead of mirroring vertex group from left bone to right bone, symmetrize vertex group(s).

Symmetry Search Distance \u00b6 Increasing symmetry search distance (red circles) gives more vertices pairs, but with too big value, the result is worsening Set search distance for finding mirrored vertices pairs.
